**Solving the Challenge**

TelcoGPT is your solution for simplifying the orchestration and management of mobile networks on cloud infrastructure.

**Why it's a Challenge Today**

Managing 5G networks and their cloud infrastructure involves navigating a maze of technologies, from infrastructure management (*ClusterAPI*, *Terraform*, *kubeadm*) to 5G deployment (*kpt*, *helm* -> *nephio*), and observability (*OpenTelemetry*). It extends to complete life-cycle management and closed loops (*Kubernetes*). These tools (and the list is ever-evolving!) demand a deep understanding of CLIs, rules, and best practices.

**The Challenge Unveiled**

TelcoGPT introduces a user-friendly interface using human-level intents for all these technologies. Simply express your intent in a straightforward text format, and let our Language Models (LLMs) handle the interpretation.

**How We Do It**

TelcoGPT relies on Language Models (LLMs) such as *GPT*, *LLama*, *Falcon*, which are not only proficient content creators but also interpreters of human intents.

**What You Gain**

TelcoGPT provides a transparency layer between OSS intents/business persons/administrators and underlying technologies to manage 5G. Once customized LLMs allow non-technical persons to manage their network (or hundreds of different private networks). Even if new technology emerges, there's no need for administrators to learn it; it will be hidden in the technological part.
